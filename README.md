# Hooli-Co.

Module 3: Git And Jenkins<br>


Problem Statement<br>

Hooli Co has put Harry and Kane to implement a new set of features in their feature software.<br> 
Both started working separately, making their own copies of the same source code.<br>
Now, it has become difficult for them to track the changes theyâ€™ve made in the original code,<br>
and they are finding it difficult to merge their code.<br>



Action Items<br>

Create two separate branches from master<br>
Make changes in the same function of the source code in both the branches<br>
Merge branch1 into the master<br>
Try and merge branch2 into the Master (merge conflict should arise)<br>
Install a merge tool of your choice and resolve the merge conflict using git mergetool command<br>
